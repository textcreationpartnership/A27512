            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>They have raiſed up a <hi>bellum Epiſcopale</hi> to daſh two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms one againſt another, to the ſhedding of much bloud, if God in mercy prevent it not.</p>
                     <p>They keep up a Romiſh Hierarchy among us, full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which they ſuffer not to be reformed.</p>
                     <p>They uphold the fore-named ſinful Prelatical and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Clergy, ſo as thoſe their Prieſts be conformable to all their Rites and Ceremonies, they may in a manner live as they liſt, and be ſupported againſt all thoſe that ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their reformation.</p>
                     <p>They are pleaſed with the peoples ignorance, and their contentedneſſe, reſting in a long read Service, without better inſtruction, holding reading to be preaching, and preaching no part of divine Service, that ſo ſuch ſilly people might be miſled in groſſe blindneſſe, periſhing for lack of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>They ſuppreſſe Lectures and alſo Sermons in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and allow no queſtions in catechiſing; but onely ſuch as be in the very common Catechiſm, much hindering increaſe of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>They will permit no Miniſter to preach nor to expound
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99376:16"/>in his own Pariſh without paying for a Licenſe, for which when he hath paid, they never care whether he preach or no.</p>
                     <p>They will allow none of the people to ſeek for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they want it at home, nor yet preſſe the Miniſter to the diſcharge of his duty, but trouble others.</p>
                     <p>They never trouble any Miniſter for neglect of his duty in preaching; But diligent preachers they have a jealous eye over, and are ready to take an occaſion to vex them, as not for their turn.</p>
                     <p>They ſinfully trouble thouſands of Church-wardens and Side men, making them ſwear to their Articles which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>They hinder prohibitions, ſtop the courſes of Law, and terrifie both Lawyers and Judges.</p>
                     <p>They dare to fine and impriſon without Law, going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond as Spiritual power; yea, and the Laws of our Land.</p>
                     <p>They have ever been plotting to enſnare Chriſts pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, that they might root them out.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. They have preſſed upon them Subſcription, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and ſo caſt out very many.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. They have urged the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> and by this they have undone not a few.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. They procured the reading of the declaration for prophaning the Lords day, and hereby many were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, excommunicated, and ſome deprived.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV When they ſaw that all theſe things would not bring to paſs their intended miſchief, they lately framed a wicked oath to be tendred to all Gods Miniſters, which whoſoever would not take ſhould be ſuſpended firſt, &amp; after deprived.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, to make up the meaſure of their evils, they have illegally given a Subſidy to be extorted from under the name of a benevolence, which who ſo ſhall refuſe to pay, is utterly undone, according to their mercileſſe decree in a Book publiſhed, which now they are loath ſhould ſee the light, and be read of any judicious and religious Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>They are the cauſe of the diviſion and ſeparation among us, by their Lordly rule; by their rigorous exacting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99376:17"/>and by their cruel dealing with ſuch, as do not obey their Lordly wills.</p>
                     <p>They ſuffer Papiſts, and nouriſh Arminians in the boſom of their Church, to the diſturbance and danger of the true Church of Chriſt, and this whole State.</p>
                     <p>They allow to vain people Revels, heatheniſh vanities, unchriſtian meetings, and that on the Lords day, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane it, and have procured a Declaration for the reading of this licencious liberty in every Church in time of Divine ſervice; and ſuch Miniſters as refuſed, they did ſuſpend, excommunicate, and ſome they deprived, the like never heard of in any Church of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>They will have bowing to Altars, and yet permit noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offenders, yea Theeves and Murt herers condemned (if they have gotten pardons) to come to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before ſatisfaction be given to the congregation, yea drunkards, blaſphemous Swearers, infamous Adulterers, and other vile perſons may receive, and not be debarred, if they can ſatisfie their Courts, and free themſelves from thence, though they do not manifeſt their repentance to the Congregation, eating and drinking the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unworthily to their own damnation, a prophaneneſs much to be lamented.</p>
                     <p>They hunt after Greatneſs, and not for goodneſs, but for gain, and do withſtand all good meanes of reformation, and all the waies of redreſſing their corrupt courſes, much to the hindrance of the growth in Religion, and walking with God.</p>

Further, this ſymbolization of Papiſts and Prelate-men in the name and nature of Maſs and Liturgy, diſcovers how they conſpire againſt the Truth, and thoſe who deſire to worſhip God in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth:</hi> it is a true maxime, <hi>Quae conveniunt in ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo tertio, conveniunt inter ſe, &amp; diſſentiunt a contrario; They who agree in a third, agree between themſelves, and diſſent from the contrary;</hi> If the Papiſts then ſort with the Service-book-men, in the liking of the Liturgy, &amp; the Service-book-men with the Papiſts in the liking of the Maſs, and ſo agree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves, they muſt both by conſequent diſſent from the true worſhip of God, which is contrary to it. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Papiſts liking of the Service-book, makes it plainly appear, how little God likes it, for if it were pleaſing to God, it would never pleaſe the Papiſts: as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> true and ſincere worſhipping of God was an <hi>Abomination</hi> to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>

                     <p>To adore in, by, or before a Creature <hi>respectively,</hi> or with a relation to the Creature, is Idolatry:</p>
                     <p>But to <hi>kneel at the Sacrament,</hi> is to <hi>adore in, by,</hi> or <hi>before</hi> a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>respectively,</hi> with relation to the Creature; Therefore it is Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>The explanation of the <hi>Terms,</hi> will make the Argument the better underſtood: as firſt, <hi>Adoration</hi> is the higheſt point of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal worſhip,</hi> which God will not admit with an intervenient or relative reſpect to any Creature: for that makes the Creature <hi>Objectum ſignificativè à quo,</hi> that is the motive of the worſhip; the <hi>Terms</hi> thus explained: this is the very ſame Argument that our learned <hi>Divines</hi> ſtop the <hi>Papiſt</hi> mouthes with, in the point of adoring God mediatly by the Creature: And as the Papiſts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the <hi>major;</hi> ſo ſence and reaſon, yea, the injunction of the Commanders, all verifie the truth of the <hi>minor</hi> in Kneelers; for they cannot deny the Elements to be the motive of their kneeling, the Concluſion then muſt needs hold; that it is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try disjunct, or improper at leaſt, as we argue againſt the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> But if the minds of thouſands of ignorant receivers in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were known, it is to be feared they fall foul on conjunct or proper Idolatry, making the Bread <hi>Octjectum determinativum,</hi> in plain, the Bread the <hi>Object of their Worſhip;</hi> with which ſin the <hi>Papiſts</hi> charge all the <hi>Proteſtant kneelers:</hi> for, <hi>if Chriſt were not
